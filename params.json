My primary\r\ntarget is French online newspapers, but I'm pretty sure you'll love to activate\r\nit on your favorite website.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n### On Chrome\r\n\r\n#### Git clone\r\n\r\nYou may eventually clone this repository via the following command line::\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/brunobord/no-comment.git\r\n\r\nThen you'll have to add the chrome extension via:\r\n\r\n    Wrench Button -> Tools -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked Extension\r\n\r\nPick the \"chrome\" directory and there you are.\r\n\r\n#### Online install\r\n\r\nOr you can install it by pointing your webkit browser to:\r\n\r\n    http://brunobord.github.com/no-comment/no-comment.crx\r\n\r\nAnd proceed with the installation.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this archive may not be updated as frequently as you may want.\r\n\r\n### On Firefox\r\n\r\nAs a prerequisite, you'll **need** to install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n#### Git clone\r\n\r\nThen you'll have to grab the custom userscript. Eventually, you can clone the\r\nrepository as indicated in the Chrome procedure, and in Firefox, do:\r\n\r\n    File -> Open\r\n\r\nAnd pick the no-comment.user.js available in the \"firefox\" directory.\r\n\r\n#### Online script install\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can point your browser to this URL:\r\n    \r\n    http://brunobord.github.com/no-comment/no-comment.user.js\r\n\r\nPlease note that this archive may not be updated as frequently as you may want.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Target websites\r\n\r\n* sudouest.fr,\r\n* lefigaro.fr,\r\n* lemonde.fr,\r\n* fr.news.yahoo.com,\r\n* ladepeche.fr,\r\n* humanite.fr,\r\n* lesechos.fr,\r\n* nouvelobs.com,\r\n* leparisien.fr,\r\n* lepoint.fr,\r\n* francefootball.fr,\r\n* lequipe.fr,\r\n* rue89.com,\r\n* youtube.com (yes, that'd mean an insane amount of rubbish out of your sight),\r\n* dailymotion.com,\r\n* vimeo.com,\r\n* twitter.com (Trending topics, you know how they became lame),\r\n\r\n(to be continued)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute, you have several choices:\r\n\r\n### Issue reporting\r\n\r\nSomething can go wrong... Something **will** go wrong. Please report it on the\r\nappropriate [github issue tracker](https://github.com/brunobord/no-comment/issues).\r\n\r\nIf you're pissed off by some news website commenters,\r\n[please report it](https://github.com/brunobord/no-comment/issues) and if\r\npossible, we may zap the comment blocks and publish an updated version of the\r\nFirefox / Chrome extension.\r\n\r\nIf you have a feature request, please submit an issue and we'll try to do our\r\nbest to help you out.\r\n\r\n### Fork / Pull requests\r\n\r\nIf you want, you can fork this repository, and, according to the License (see\r\nbelow), you can do whatever you want with it. Of course, we do accept legit \r\npull requests, as long as they improve this extension.\r\n\r\n#### Requisites\r\n\r\nYou'll have to install Fabric. In a virtualenv or globally:\r\n\r\n    pip install fabric\r\n\r\n#### Add a website\r\n\r\nIf you want to add a website, edit the ``sites.json`` file and add a block like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"mywebsite\": {\r\n        \"matches\": [\"http://*.example.com/*\"],\r\n        \"domain\": [\"example.com\"],\r\n        \"selectors\": [\"#comment\"]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, run:\r\n\r\n    fab build\r\n\r\nThis will produce a ``mywebsite.css`` file in the ``chrome/css`` directory and\r\nmodify the other files (manifest.json and the GreaseMonkey userscript).\r\n\r\nTest and double-check that your extension is working by installing the\r\nGreaseMonkey userscript in your Firefox and/or loading the \"unpacked\" extension\r\nin your Chrome browser. Once you're done, push everything with a nice commit\r\nmessage, and call for a pull request.\r\n\r\n#### Other \"TODOs\"\r\n\r\n\"No Comment\" is only available for Chrome and Firefox. This needs to be extended\r\nto other browsers. If you know how to (simply) implement this extension for other\r\nbrowsers, please get in touch with us via the Github Issues and we'll try to\r\nspread happiness and joy around us.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis piece of Software is released under the terms of the WTFPL.
