No comment
==========

A collection of Userstyles to remove comments on various news websites. 
My primary target is French newspapers, but I'm pretty sure you'll love to
activate it on your favorite website.

So far, I've only been able to write a chrome extension. Don't worry, I'm
not going to make it "webkit-only", and as soon as I can figure it out, I'll
try to make it cross-brower.

You can grab the "0.1" version here: http://media.jehaisleprintemps.net/chrome-ext/no-comment.crx
