# No comment

A collection of Userstyles to remove comments on various news websites. 
My primary target is French newspapers, but I'm pretty sure you'll love to
activate it on your favorite website.

## Install

### On Chrome / Webkit

You may eventually clone this repository via the following command line::

    git clone https://github.com/brunobord/no-comment.git

Then you'll have to add the chrome extension via:

    Wrench Button -> Tools -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked Extension

Pick the "chrome" directory and there you are.

### On Firefox

As a prerequisite, you'll **need** to install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
first.

Then you'll have to grab the custom userscript. Eventually, you can clone the
repository as indicated in the Chrome procedure, and in Firefox, do:

    File -> Open

And pick the no-comment.user.js available in the "firefox" directory.

## Target websites
